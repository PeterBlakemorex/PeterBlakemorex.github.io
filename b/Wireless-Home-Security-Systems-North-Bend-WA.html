<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems intended to summon authorities department workers, requires registration, assessment of fees for extreme false burglar alarms, supplies procedures for repeat wrongdoers, and supplies an efficient date.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is extremely sensible, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
