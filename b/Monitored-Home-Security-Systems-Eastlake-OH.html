<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras are compatible with network video recorders (NVRs), which use a number of other advantages over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. In other words, NVR records higher-quality video and enables systems to be scaled up far more quickly than can be done with DVR.
