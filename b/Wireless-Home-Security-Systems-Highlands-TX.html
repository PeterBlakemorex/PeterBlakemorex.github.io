Do you want to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Note that these sirens might break local sound control laws, so examine ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>

Another potential disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically offset by the reality that there are no installation expenses.</p>
