Reliability has actually long been at the heart of the dispute over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's an argument that's typically manipulated by factors such as suspicion over the vulnerability of wireless systems, consisting of interference from radio signals and glitches that cause false alarms. While enhancements over the last few years have actually made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own special wireless technology, which can't be disrupted by other signals), issues continue over vulnerabilities that do not impact hardwired systems.</p>
<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that required professional installation. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, usage equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, featured long and normally onerous agreements, and often count on the exact same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they use little benefit. A good example is the Vivint system, which we have actually reviewed independently and don't recommend for many people.</p>
