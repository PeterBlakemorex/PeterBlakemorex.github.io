<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
