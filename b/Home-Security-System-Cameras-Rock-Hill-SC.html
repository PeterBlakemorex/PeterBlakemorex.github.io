The one time where lag does become a little bit of a problem is between taping and finding movement. Due to the fact that the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to actually switch on when it detects motion.

Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if needed, could just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
