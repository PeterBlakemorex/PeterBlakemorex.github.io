<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
