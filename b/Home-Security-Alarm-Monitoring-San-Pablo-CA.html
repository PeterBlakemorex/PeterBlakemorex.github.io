<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more pricey for the same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are difficult, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyway.</p>
<p>For instance, the bullet cameras with repaired lens are usually smaller than those with zoom lens. SimpliSafe has the most excellent action time of all home security companies we reviewed. Their timeframe for action in under 10 seconds, which we must admit is rather remarkable. A note of value, if you wish to get the SimpliSafe app, then you would need to subscribe to the more costly monitoring plan.</p>
