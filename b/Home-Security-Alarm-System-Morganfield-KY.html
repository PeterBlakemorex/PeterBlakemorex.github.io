<p>Piza and coworkers (2019) performed a new review of the literature to upgrade a meta-analysis by Welsh and Farrington (2008) that took a look at the effects of closed-circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance on criminal activity avoidance. The scientists looked for CCTV examinations released between 2007 and 2017 to represent the duration since the last review (which covered assessments completed in 2006 and earlier).

<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously impressive piece of innovation. For starters, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). When you envision a home security camera, it's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you might call to mind. The first wireless function to think about is the security system and its parts, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box.

Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and increase the size of whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still be able to see things clearly.</p>
