It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
