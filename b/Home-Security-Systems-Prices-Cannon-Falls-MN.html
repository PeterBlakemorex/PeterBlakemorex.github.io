<p>Somewhat more pricey than our winning clever alarm, this system was almost as easy to install and, throughout screening, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if one of the sensors had actually been triggered. We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is created by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no false signals). Nevertheless, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have extra sensors and key fobs, too.</p>
