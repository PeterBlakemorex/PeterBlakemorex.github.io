<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>The most significant, baddest feature is the Arlo Ultra's 4K video streaming with HDR, which gives you extremely crisp, clear footage that lets you zoom in on information like faces and license plates without messing up your image quality. The Nest Labs Nest Camera provides higher-than-typical 1080p video resolution. Ramping up into security services fits with this, too. Lennar, as it occurs, is straight linked now on Amazon's security homepage, but to be clear, the offering is not special to Lennar property owners. </p>
