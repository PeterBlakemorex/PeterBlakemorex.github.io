<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security since it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
