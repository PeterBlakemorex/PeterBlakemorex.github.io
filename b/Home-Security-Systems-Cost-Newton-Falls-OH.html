<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in numerous areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service.

Although FrontPoint offers a variety of equipment and home automation products at a sensible cost, the one location where the company especially excels remains in DIY installation. </p>
