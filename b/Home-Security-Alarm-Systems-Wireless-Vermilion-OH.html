<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the exact same way as public cameras? We also need to draw fine lines about 'Who actually is enjoying you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big sibling? The Corporates? Or bothering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing viewing outside a window it could be a crime, yet the same person might put a surveillance camera then remotely see an individual within the privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not versus the chastening code.</p>
<p>So why don't we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT frustrates us. We see a lot of growing companies branching out and trying new things in the home security space. But ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the customer service experience varies commonly depending upon the dealer you choose. </p>
