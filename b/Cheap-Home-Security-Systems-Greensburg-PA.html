<h3>Monitored Home Alarm Systems in Greensburg PA</h3>

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the deck by a licensed electrical expert (who takes place to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>

Nevertheless, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the consumer. </p>
