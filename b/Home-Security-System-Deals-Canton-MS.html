Techniques included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV examination study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV assessments, and contacting leading researchers to inquire about forthcoming examinations. Both published and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was global in scope.</p>
