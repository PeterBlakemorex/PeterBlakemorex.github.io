<p>We didn't think about alarm that required expert installation. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, usage equipment comparable to that of Do It Yourself systems, included long and normally onerous contracts, and often depend on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they offer little benefit.

<p>Prior to acquiring an alarm, it's important to determine your family's needs.

<p>Whether you decide to choose a Do It Yourself system or choose an expertly installed system, you'll have to pay a yearly or regular monthly cost if you need monitoring, and in some cases, you'll be hit with a month-to-month charge to pay off the cost of hardware elements. With most Do It Yourself systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Set, the Ring Alarm Security Set, and the Nest Secure, you purchase the hardware outright and can prevent any regular monthly costs if you choose to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, charges will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly. The cost of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you devote to a three-year contract. Ring's Protect Plus plan opts for $10 monthly and does not require an agreement.</p>
