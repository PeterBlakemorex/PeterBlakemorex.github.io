<h3>Wireless Home Security in Indiana</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's stats considering that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest offender for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capability is a bit limited to advise as a top pick.</p>
<p>During our testing, this compact camera taped sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom worked for taking a closer look. We especially like this camera's large, 180-degree field of view, because you're less likely to get a blind area wherever you set it up. For less than $400, you get two door and window sensors, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>

Unless you just have one door and one window, you'll require more than the only contact sensing unit that is available in Ring's five-piece kit.</p>
