<h3>Wireless Home Security in Indiana</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's stats considering that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest offender for brief battery life by far.

<p>During our testing, this compact camera taped sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom worked for taking a closer look. We especially like this camera's large, 180-degree field of view, because you're less likely to get a blind area wherever you set it up. For less than $400, you get two door and window sensors, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
