<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra doesn't come with a free tier of cloud storage, so you have to invest a minimum of $3 each month if you wish to conserve any videos. And if you wish to save 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera each month, on top of the regular monthly strategy, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.

When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends out double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if required, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
