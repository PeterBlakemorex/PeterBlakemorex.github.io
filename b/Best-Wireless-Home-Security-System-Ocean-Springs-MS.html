<p>But monitored systems likewise tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly charge for a set amount of time, normally one to five years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-term plan, are ending up being more common. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service contract. Spending for the equipment in advance provides you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as often times as you want.</p>
