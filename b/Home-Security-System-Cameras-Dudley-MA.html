<p>Numerous monitors were installed within the new command center with a single monitor appointed to alarm displays. As soon as any alarm integrated into the PCU was activated, the closest camera to that place would be displayed on that specific monitor. The chance that the fixed camera would be pointed in the instructions of the event depends upon the preliminary requirements for area of coverage. If there are three select emergency exits, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single fixed camera can only enjoy one.
