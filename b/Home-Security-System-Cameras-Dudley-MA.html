<p>Numerous monitors were installed within the new command center with a single monitor appointed to alarm displays. As soon as any alarm integrated into the PCU was activated, the closest camera to that place would be displayed on that specific monitor. The chance that the fixed camera would be pointed in the instructions of the event depends upon the preliminary requirements for area of coverage. If there are three select emergency exits, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single fixed camera can only enjoy one. This creates a one in 3 chance of catching a specific occurrence on video (either live or recorded). The command center likewise included a computer designated for filing occurrence reports online.

<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in areas where they are thought to be most efficient, which generally consists of highly inhabited towns, town hall, car parks, or different other high-crime areas (Welsh and Farrington 2008).

In many cases, Geographic Info Systems innovation is utilized to specifically assess criminal offense patterns for camera placement; however, the positioning of cameras can also be the result of input from police officers and other criminal justice stakeholders (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>
<p>If you hold down the panic or emergency alarm buttons on the alarm system touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is sent to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency situation services are dispatched right away.
