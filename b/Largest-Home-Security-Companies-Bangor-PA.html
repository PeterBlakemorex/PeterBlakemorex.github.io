And while this is a quite standard feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>

<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly attempted to provide it an attractive edge, and we have to give credit to its capability to show what's going on from up to 4 cameras at a time. It can be slow and uncomfortable to use on event - with the process of connecting to the camera for a live view rather sluggish sometimes. The previous, cheaper version of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you want to save some money - it does have a cable connected though, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit easier to sabotage for possible intruders. Certainly one of the best security cameras in 2020.</p>
