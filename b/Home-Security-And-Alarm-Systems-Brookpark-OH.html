<p>A tight wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>

Many sites requiring alarm setups no longer have standard telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with standard telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
