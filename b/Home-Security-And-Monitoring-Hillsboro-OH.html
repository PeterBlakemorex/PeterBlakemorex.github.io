With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into consideration. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal.
