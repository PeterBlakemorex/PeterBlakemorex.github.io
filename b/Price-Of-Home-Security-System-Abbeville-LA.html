This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can introduce a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key recorded during the network healing.</p>

Modern systems now have remarkable abilities", though these have actually developed reasonable misgivings about the threat for privacy and possible abuse such capabilities create.
