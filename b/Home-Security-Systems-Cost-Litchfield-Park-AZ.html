<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to third party companies? I've dropped my Nest Cams since they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to think of. Sirens. So your camera has detected trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice. Note that these sirens may violate local noise control laws, so check ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>

However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer care experience differs commonly depending upon the dealer you choose. </p>
