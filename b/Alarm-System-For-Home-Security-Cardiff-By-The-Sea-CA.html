You can do so without a contract if you desire to add service. SimpliSafe provides 3 basic packages ranging from monitoring only to monitoring with app access.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
