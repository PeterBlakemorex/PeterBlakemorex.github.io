<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send mobile phone signals with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
