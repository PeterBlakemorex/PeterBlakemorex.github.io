<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". This model from Samsung Wisenet will fit the bill if you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality. It ships with 4 streamlined and white bullet-style cameras designed for indoor and outdoor usage. They're equipped with night vision tech that uses infrared LEDs and wise IR to supply up to130ft (or 40m) night vision variety. Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our testing that the app periodically forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>
<p>The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image.
