<p>One essential exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 per month, which might be an economical choice for consumers in backwoods.

A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>Another benefit to monitored systems is if you buy a monitored security plan, the very same company that keeps an eye on the system will install it for you. If you're not mechanically likely, having an expert set up the system may give you more self-confidence than if you did the work yourself.
