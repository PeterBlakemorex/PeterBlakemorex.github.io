<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
