<p>Something that should be thought about when installing CCTV cameras is how they will be powered, and how circuitry will be run throughout the structure. In a lot of cases, you'll have the ability to install cameras and electrical wiring simply by running the wires through a drop tile ceiling and into the wall.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security given that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
