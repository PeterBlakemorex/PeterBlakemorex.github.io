<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out mobile phone alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
