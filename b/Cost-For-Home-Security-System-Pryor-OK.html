<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. The smart bit is that the camera not only finds that individuals have entered its 130-degree field of view, but it will also have a stab at identifying them too. Possibly more usefully, if someone passes who the camera doesn't understand, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it need to immediately know.</p>
<p>Clearly, there's a big distinction in between the most recent clever home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you require (or can pay for) as well as integrate everything to deal with other smart gizmos such as the lighting and heating, helping to develop an all-inclusive wise home, not simply an alarm system.</p>

<p>During our screening, this compact camera taped sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom was useful for taking a more detailed look.

For less than $400, you get 2 door and window sensors, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
