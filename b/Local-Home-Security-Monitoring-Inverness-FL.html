<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has plainly attempted to give it an appealing edge, and we have to provide credit to its capability to reveal what's going on from up to 4 cameras at a time. It can be slow and awkward to utilize on occasion - with the procedure of linking to the camera for a live view rather languid at times. The previous, more affordable variation of the outdoor Nest cam is still on sale too if you wish to save some cash - it does have a cable attached though, rather than working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit simpler to screw up for possible burglars.
