<p>Another wireless camera setup, this Zosi 8-channel system records in Full HD and includes 4 weatherproof cameras that can be attached outside to walls.

<p>If you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at, there's no use in having an outdoor security camera.

When a client pushes the emergency button, it sends double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if required, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
