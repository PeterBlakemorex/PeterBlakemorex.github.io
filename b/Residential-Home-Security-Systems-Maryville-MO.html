<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive enemy, since the disturbance of the network avoids the circulation of data and actually indirectly safeguards data by preventing it from being sent. The typical factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying an opportunity for the harmful assaulter to tape these codes and utilize different splitting tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can release a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based on the "design" security essential caught throughout the network recovery.</p>
