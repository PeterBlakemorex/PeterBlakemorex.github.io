<h2>Problems With Wireless Outdoor Security Cameras Bellerose</h2>
<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I remained in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Truly frustrating. Once again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, due to the fact that apparently they auto renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.
