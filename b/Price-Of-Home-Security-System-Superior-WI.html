<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send out mobile phone alerts with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
