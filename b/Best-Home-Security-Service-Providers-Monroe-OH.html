<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically safer, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel practically susceptible.

It likewise has a USB slot so you can record your footage straight onto there, which saves you needing to deal with the cloud storage system described above.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensors, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
