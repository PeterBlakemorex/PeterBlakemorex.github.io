For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; nevertheless, nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage generally include either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage alternative saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This alternative is normally cost-free. A cloud storage option saves your video in the cloud. Nevertheless, this is generally a paid service and the number of hours it will store will depend on how much cloud storage you want to pay for.</p>
