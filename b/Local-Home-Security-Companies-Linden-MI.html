Strategies included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV evaluation research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV evaluations, and getting in touch with leading researchers to inquire about forthcoming evaluations. Both released and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was international in scope.</p>
