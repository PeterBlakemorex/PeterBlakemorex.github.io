<p>I explained that all we would require to do is tap into any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, which camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if required, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
