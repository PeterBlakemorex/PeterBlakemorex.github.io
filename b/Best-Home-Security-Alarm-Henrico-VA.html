<h3>Best House Security System Henrico VA 23231</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly became a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send alerts, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even recognize people you have actually identified (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most cost-efficient monitoring strategy starting at $10. You can get all the essentials like email, sms, and push informs, along with 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's most inexpensive, Always On" strategy. However, you will have to spend for extra $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) monthly, and this doesn't featured expert monitoring. This additional cost isn't ideal, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- respective minimum prices monthly for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal. </p>
