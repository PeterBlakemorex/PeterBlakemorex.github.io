<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
