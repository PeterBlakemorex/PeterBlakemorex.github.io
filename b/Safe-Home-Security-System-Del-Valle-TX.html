Porter therefore kept in mind that the Office and surveillance industry should make sure just software and hardware compliant with relevant requirements, such as Secure by Default, is installed in personal and public spaces alike.</p>
<p>The San Diego Cops Department hoped to get to video footage from public and private cameras in real time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego" surveillance program As of 2014, the program was riddled with software compatibility issues, and officers had trouble seeing video footage in real time because the department's police car did not have a 4G connection.
