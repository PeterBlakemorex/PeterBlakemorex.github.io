However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
