<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out signals, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

The very first digit following the IP prefix informs you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of strong things such as wind-blown dust and varies from 0 (no protection) to 6 (overall protection versus dust and dirt). The 2nd number tells you how resistant the camera is to moisture and ranges from 0 (no protection) to 9 (safeguarded versus close quarters, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
