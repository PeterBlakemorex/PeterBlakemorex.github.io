<h2>Alfred Home Security Camera, Baby&Pet Monitor CCTV Fitchburg</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system typically included several cameras linked-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit tv (CCTV) or monitor.

Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to disregard items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
