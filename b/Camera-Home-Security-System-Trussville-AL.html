<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients recognize that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
