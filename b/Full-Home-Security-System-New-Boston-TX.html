<p>Frontpoint provides five packages and 2 monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester went with the Interactive plan however wound up disappointed with its absence of live video surveillance.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually identified (after a learning duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>

You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the person being seen know they're being seen, and you can pick to record video clips or photos and conserve them to your wise device on a whim. </p>
