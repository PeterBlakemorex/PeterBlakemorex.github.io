<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are a little more expensive for the same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are difficult, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
