<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
