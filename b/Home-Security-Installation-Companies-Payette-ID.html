<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
