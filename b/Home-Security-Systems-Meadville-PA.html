<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>

Older homeowners might be postponed by the absence of a keypad in the main hub, nevertheless lots of consumers must be completely comfy controlling everything through their smart phones.</p>
