<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
