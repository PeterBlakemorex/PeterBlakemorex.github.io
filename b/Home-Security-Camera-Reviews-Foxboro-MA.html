<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
