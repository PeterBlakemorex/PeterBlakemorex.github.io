<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you've labeled (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will respond. It likewise implies that if you really saw a burglar riffle through your home, you might rapidly tape-record a message to him or her through your mobile phone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you envision, would be enough to send out even the most committed career criminal scuttling empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
