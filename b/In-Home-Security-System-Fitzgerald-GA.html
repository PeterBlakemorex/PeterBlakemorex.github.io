<p>Costs for systems differ. Larger systems that offer full-house coverage with professional monitoring are the most expensive options. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most budget friendly choice. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio typically work like walkie talkies.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
