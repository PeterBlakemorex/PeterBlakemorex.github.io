<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
