<p>Unlike traditional burglar alarms, which have a control board (usually positioned in the entryway hall) that is used to arm and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensors have actually been set off, smart alarms are controlled from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually currently left home, and alerts you if any of the sensing units have been triggered, rather than getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially frustrating your neighbours).

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
