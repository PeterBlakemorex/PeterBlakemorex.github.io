<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that give access to a home's security app to up to 20 relative. However, shared monitoring isn't a feature readily available from all companies. Be sure to look into the company's features or speak with a representative straight if this is a high top priority.

Many sites requiring alarm setups no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with standard telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some types of VoIP service.</p>
