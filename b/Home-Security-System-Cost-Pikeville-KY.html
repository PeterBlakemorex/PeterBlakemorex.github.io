<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which might be an economical alternative for clients in rural areas.

Although FrontPoint uses a wide array of equipment and home automation items at a sensible cost, the one area where the company particularly excels remains in DIY installation. </p>
