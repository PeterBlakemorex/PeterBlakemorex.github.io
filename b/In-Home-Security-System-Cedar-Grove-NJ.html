Regardless of that, the alarm should be enough to frighten trespassers in many cases. To hold and recover costs alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company need to be licensed, pay any registration or false alarm costs, and provide physical evidence like camera video footage or a broken window to warrant police response.</p>
