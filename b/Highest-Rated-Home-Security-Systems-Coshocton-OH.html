<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights during the night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
