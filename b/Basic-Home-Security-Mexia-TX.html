<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very typical type of two piece sensor that runs with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either generally open or usually closed when under the impact of an electromagnetic field as when it comes to proximity to the second piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, again based on whether the design is normally open or generally closed. This action coupled with an electric current (generally at 12V DC) permits an alarm control board to find a fault on that zone or circuit.
