<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered an information breach, however we concur with its suggestion that users need to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such occurrences. Nevertheless, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we don't think that these problems alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our current recommendation.</p>
