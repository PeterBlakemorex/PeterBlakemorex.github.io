<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Ring for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small charge.

When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
