<p>After purchasing, setting up, and using these systems for 8 months, we found four standout companies. Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe all provide an impressive client experience and instinctive, innovative security tech. We 'd be comfortable equipping our own homes with any of them-- although each excels in a specific location.
