<p>Simply a couple years back, the home security industry was controlled by a few big names offering pricey, stiff plans with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-lasting contracts. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensors linked to a keypad control board and run through a landline. Nowadays, this has all altered.
