<p>Another essential topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much suffices. In this article, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image.

Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
