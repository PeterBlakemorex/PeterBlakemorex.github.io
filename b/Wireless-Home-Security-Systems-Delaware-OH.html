<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is certainly something to be considered. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent option for long range situations where trees and poles are not present.</p>
<p>Installation - Who will establish the equipment? Companies like House, SimpliSafe, and Frontpoint sell equipment for DIY setup.
