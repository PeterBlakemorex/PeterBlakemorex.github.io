<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send mobile phone notifies with that info when they show up at your home.
