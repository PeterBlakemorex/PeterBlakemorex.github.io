<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually clearly tried to provide it an appealing edge, and we have to offer credit to its ability to reveal what's going on from up to four cameras at a time. It can be uncomfortable and slow to utilize on occasion - with the process of connecting to the camera for a live view rather sluggish sometimes. The previous, less expensive variation of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you wish to save some cash - it does have actually a cable television attached however, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit much easier to sabotage for potential burglars.
