<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more expensive for the same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are onerous, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
