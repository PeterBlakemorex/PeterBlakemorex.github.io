The primary distinction is the way the signal is sent out Analogue systems turn the signal into a format a Video recorder or tv screen can get. The IP camera digitises the signal and sends it out by means of packets over a network connection.</p>
<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can deal with every camera. Naturally, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, however the compatibility question extends well beyond that distinction. Some NVR systems, for example, work with the IP cameras just from certain manufacturers and not others. When purchasing a video recorder, you must initially make sure that the gadget will work with the cameras you've bought. If you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras should have the ability to supply you with the essential info.</p>
