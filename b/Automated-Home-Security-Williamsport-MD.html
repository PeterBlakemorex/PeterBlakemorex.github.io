We've been testing Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we actually like the system for what it is. So what is it?

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
