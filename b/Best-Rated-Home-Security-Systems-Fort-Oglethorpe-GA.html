<p>Wireless security cameras utilize your home or companies WiFi connection to produce a surveillance network. These are fantastic to utilize to monitor small to medium sized spaces and structures due to the fact that they tend to get image distortion when zooming in to items that are far away.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send out smart device alerts with that details when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
