<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it captures a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone alerts and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is poor. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was developed for homeowners. It should be installed by a professional alarm installation team and, once set up, is difficult to move from one location to another.
