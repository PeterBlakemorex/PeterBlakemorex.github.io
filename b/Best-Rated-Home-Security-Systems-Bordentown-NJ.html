The image is clear and sharp and I saw very little lag between my actions and the image showed on the app. I 'd certainly state it is among the better cameras in terms of video quality.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
