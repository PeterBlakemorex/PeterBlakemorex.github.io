We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capability is a bit minimal to suggest as a top choice.</p>

<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you've identified (after a learning period).
