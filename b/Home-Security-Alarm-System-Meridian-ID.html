It was extremely simple to establish, as the parts are pre-paired to the base station, and it fasted to activate when any of the sensing units were activated. We love that it includes both external and internal sirens and will even work with Philips Hue wise lights, too. The instructions are very comprehensive and the 200m range of the alarm implies it can be utilized to protect sheds and garages as well as your home.
