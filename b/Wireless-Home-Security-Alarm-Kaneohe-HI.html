<p>Some people would rather pay an alarm company the regular monthly monitoring rate rather of purchasing a self-monitored security system. Professionally monitored security systems require a monthly monitoring charge that can range from ($ 20 to $60) each month. When determining how much a burglar alarm costs customers need to recognize that if they include more features, the cost will increase.</p>
<p>Most of the self-monitored starter packages do not consist of outdoor cameras. Outdoor cameras are a bit harder to install considering that they need to be mounted to a home.
