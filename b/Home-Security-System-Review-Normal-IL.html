<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the specific very same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric current.

Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
