Because the system is wired into your home, it doesn't need to count on a wi-fi network in order to relay info. Rather of using wi-fi, a wired system works like a landline.</p>
<p>Adding an exterior video camera gives you a lot more control over your home's security.

For example, if you need to record high-definition surveillance video over extended periods, bandwidth is a factor to consider.</p>

You're just responsible for the month-to-month monitoring cost and any optional upgrades. There's also a price match assurance.</p>
