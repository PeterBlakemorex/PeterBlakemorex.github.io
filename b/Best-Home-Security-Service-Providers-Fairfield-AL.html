Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

We should note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
