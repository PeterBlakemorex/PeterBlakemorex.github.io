<h2>A Guide To Monitored Alarm Systems Blackshear</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the highly advanced yet economical systems readily available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and watch it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>

And while this is a quite basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>
