For starters, Deep Learning allows someone to find what they are trying to find without having to search through hours of useless video footage.  Imagine a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the components you are looking for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we simply type police" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have an effective solution for collecting and capturing bad guys evidence.</p>

Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year contract, but since Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment.

But if you may upgrade to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
