<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you want to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract..

<p>Another important subject to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much suffices. In this article, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much image information as 1080p.
