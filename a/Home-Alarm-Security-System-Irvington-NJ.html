<h2>Alfred Home Security Camera, Baby&Pet Monitor CCTV Irvington</h2>
<p>I have this camera linked to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights in the evening are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.
