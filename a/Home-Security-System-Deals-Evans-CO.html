<p>Nothing is more important than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't need to purchase a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your home and possessions.

We need to note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
