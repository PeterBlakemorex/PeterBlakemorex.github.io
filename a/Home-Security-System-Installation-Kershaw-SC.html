Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment prices is extremely sensible, so it's not an overall splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
