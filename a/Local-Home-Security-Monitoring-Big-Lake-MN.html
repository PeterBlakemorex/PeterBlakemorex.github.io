Remember: A home larger than 4,500 square feet is usually better off utilizing a wired system.</p>
<h2>Video Surveillance Systems And Services Big Lake</h2>
<p>Composite Video Interface, or CVI, cameras integrate the best functions of both analog and IP cameras. CVI cameras can be a good compromise between IP and analog if you have an existing analog system or are just beginning your video surveillance journey.
