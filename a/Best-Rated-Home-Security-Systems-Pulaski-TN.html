Some NVR systems, for instance, are compatible with the IP cameras only from particular makers and not others. When buying a video recorder, you should first make sure that the device will work with the cameras you've purchased. If you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras ought to have the ability to supply you with the needed information.</p>
