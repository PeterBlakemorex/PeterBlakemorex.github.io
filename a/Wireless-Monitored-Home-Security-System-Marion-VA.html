<p>If you do experience a home intrusion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am a little disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food processor whereas many other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB.

<p>Sonitrol's wireless security systems use real-time informs through a secure cellular connection, so no electric or phone lines are required. If you are experiencing a internet, power or phone  service interruption, the system consists of a battery back-up and still signals an emergency to our call center. Likewise, there are no wires or cable televisions for an intruder to tamper or cut with.</p>
<p>However, wired systems aren't without their drawbacks. They tend to be more costly to install, needing the expertise of certified experts. As infrastructure, sensors and circuitry require to be positioned inside the walls, which involves drilling and connecting sensors to low-voltage wires, so there's professional labor to consider. Uninstalling, re-installing a system and moving is particularly bothersome and generally inadvisable, because it indicates putting old hardware in a new location.</p>
