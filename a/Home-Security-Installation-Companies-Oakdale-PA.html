<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
