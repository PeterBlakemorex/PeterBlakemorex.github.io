<p>One essential exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 per month, which could be a budget friendly option for clients in rural areas. We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're far more secure than landline systems, however there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't offered.
