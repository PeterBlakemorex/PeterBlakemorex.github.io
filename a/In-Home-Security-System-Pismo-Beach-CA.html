<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and runs its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service consists of an advantage called ASAPer, which concurrently messages a group of pre-set contacts to identify whether alarm activity is a true emergency or incorrect alarm. Many monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow reaction times.</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?
