<p>Our ADT Seattle group uses professional home security installation and a variety of security and automation products and solutions. We likewise like that the Kasa Cam Outdoor will not spend a lot (it costs $88.16 at the time of composing), and it's very easy to install. Purchasing numerous Arlo Pro 2's can get expensive. (A four-camera pack expenses $504.72 at the time of writing.) However we can't fault Arlo too much for that-- any high-quality multi-camera system is going to hit your wallet hard.</p>

Incorrect home network setups, flaws in the devices or password compromise might permit a hacker to burglarize the system and figure out if anyone is home, or perhaps take control.

After a time, video can be compressed to conserve storage area, for instance.</p>
