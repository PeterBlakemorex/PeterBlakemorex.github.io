<p>The House Smart Security Package, our previous runner-up, is still a solid choice for some people. House has upgraded that version with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which offers a better variety for sensors. Both the original Home system and the Residence Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we tested that also deals with HomeKit. We've come across a few technical problems while long-term testing the Residence Iota, and so will continue to test and upgrade accordingly. We no longer suggest it.</p>
<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. If your camera discovers motion or sound, you can trigger a video or a SmartThings automation. This series of occasions also operates in reverse. For example, if somebody opens your front door when your SmartThings system is set to away," you can tape-record a clip and sound your Arlo siren (which happens to be the loudest of the three sirens). Or, if Arlo Pro spots a noise, you can have your lights set to switch on. Unfortunately, the integration with SmartThings still has bugs and not everything works as it should; nevertheless, the potential is still there.</p>

We have actually seen it highlight mice, vehicles, and moths.</p>

It will record clips when it sees movement (and a few seconds prior to so you get the full view of what occurred) and you can view these for a week before they're deleted. You can extend the quantity of days you get by acquiring a subscription, but I do not believe the majority of people will require that alternative.</p>
