<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too easily, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop alerts (and recording, because it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with two Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over two months.</p>
<p>Security: There have been a lot of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, child screens, and other Wi-Fi gadgets to spy on people, so be sure to inspect what actions has each manufacturer taken to remove this issue.

<p>After purchasing, setting up, and utilizing these systems for eight months, we found 4 standout companies. Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe all offer an impressive client experience and intuitive, innovative security tech. We 'd be comfy outfitting our own homes with any of them-- although each master a specific area.

While a typical contract runs 42 months (among the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is just for users who want to lease their equipment. Vivint has no minimum contract requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
<p>So what happens if something triggers your alarm but you remain in a meeting with a vendor and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed getaway and your spotty cell service means you do not get alerted until the next day? The sound may frighten off would-be intruders-- if you're lucky if your system equipment includes an audible alarm. However the authorities won't come up until you personally call them. </p>
