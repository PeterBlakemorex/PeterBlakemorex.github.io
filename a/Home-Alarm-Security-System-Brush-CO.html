<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false complacency given that it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
