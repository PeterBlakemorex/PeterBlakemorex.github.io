The Ring Stick Up Webcam is available in wired and battery variations, which can be used inside and outdoors. However neither can tape-record constantly, and they both need the Ring Safeguard strategy to catch recordings. Likewise, the wired variation generally left spaces of up to 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips.
