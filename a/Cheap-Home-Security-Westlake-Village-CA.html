<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disturbance principle based upon 2 unshielded (or 'leaky') coax cables buried roughly 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter emits continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is gotten by the other cable. When the modification in field strength weakens due to the existence of an item and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is generated. The system is hidden after installation.

<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly charge for a set quantity of time, generally one to five years.

These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service contract. Spending for the equipment in advance offers you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service.
