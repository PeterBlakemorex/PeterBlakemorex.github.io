As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
