<p>There's less time and trouble involved when it comes to installation if you decide for a wireless surveillance system. Suggestion: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset.

<p>Expenses for systems differ. Larger systems that use full-house coverage with professional monitoring are the most pricey alternatives.

<p>If I liked the look of the Nest, then I love the Hive View's design - surely the most aesthetically pleasing camera on this list.
