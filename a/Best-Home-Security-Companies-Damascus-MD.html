<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its promise of up to one year of battery life.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
