<p>Simply a couple decades back, the home security market was dominated by a few big names providing costly, stiff plans with little versatility and hostile, long-term agreements.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency because it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
