We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

Improper home network configurations, defects in the gadgets or password compromise could enable a hacker to burglarize the system and identify if anybody is home, or even take control.

Night vision is consisted of too, for when the lights go out. </p>
