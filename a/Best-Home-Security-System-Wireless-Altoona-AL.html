<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, however it means you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will respond.
