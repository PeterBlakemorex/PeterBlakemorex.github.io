With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>

Which, you think of, would be enough to send out even the most dedicated career criminal scampering empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
