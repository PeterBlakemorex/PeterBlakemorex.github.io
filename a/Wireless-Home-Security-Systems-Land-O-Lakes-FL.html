<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't need to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your residential or commercial property and ownerships. In case your alarm system is triggered, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security professionals are standing by to respond by instantly connecting with you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or cops authorities.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively common.

With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
