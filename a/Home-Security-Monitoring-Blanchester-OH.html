<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smart device notifies with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
