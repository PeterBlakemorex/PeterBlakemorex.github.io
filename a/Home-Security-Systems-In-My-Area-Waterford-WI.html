<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a house owner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by an area cat, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>

These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of cops departments use several "totally free" incorrect alarms prior to enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is significant right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers bring into question the appropriateness of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or four complimentary false alarms per calendar year, since they provide no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
