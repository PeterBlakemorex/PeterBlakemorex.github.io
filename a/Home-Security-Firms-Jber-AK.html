<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually plainly tried to offer it an attractive edge, and we have to provide credit to its capability to reveal what's going on from approximately four cameras at a time. It can be awkward and sluggish to utilize on occasion - with the process of linking to the camera for a live view rather languid at times. The previous, cheaper version of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you want to conserve some money - it does have a cable connected though, rather than working wirelessly, which means it's a bit much easier to screw up for possible trespassers.
