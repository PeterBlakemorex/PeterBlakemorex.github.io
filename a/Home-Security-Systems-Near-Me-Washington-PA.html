<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
