<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer.

Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>

Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires.

Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
