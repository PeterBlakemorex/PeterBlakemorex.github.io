<p>One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 each month, which might be a budget friendly option for customers in rural areas.

If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still better than no security at all.</p>
<p>You'll get current equipment from Link Interactive and a highly-rated mobile app. Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive offers as much as 48 sensing units in its basic package, including both fire and CO alarms.
