<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". According to a report published by the Urban Institute, authorities departments nationwide respond to countless incorrect alarms from person and business security systems every year. This costs towns and cities millions of dollars in squandered police resources.

Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, since apparently they car renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a headache, method too costly, and not terrific.</p>

If you include monitoring, fees will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 each month. If you devote to a three-year agreement, the rate of the Nest service drops to $19 monthly. Ring's Protect Plus strategy opts for $10 monthly and does not require an agreement.</p>

However you can't buy this camera by itself-- you need to add to a full Vivint home security system. </p>
