<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't recommend it since its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
<p>Instead of having sensitivity settings, Circle Safe Premium can filter event notices by High Activity, Days, or Individual within the Logi Circle app (offered for iOS and Android devices and as a Web app).

Logitech makes it simple to browse through events by clicking a series of bubbles.</p>
