<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to leave the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Truly irritating. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, due to the fact that apparently they auto renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.
