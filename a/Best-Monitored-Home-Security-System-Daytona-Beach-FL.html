However Netatmo has expanded its security range with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to release a clever smoke alarm and siren later on this year, which makes this an even better proposal.</p>
