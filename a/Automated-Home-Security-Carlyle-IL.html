<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against fraud, theft, and vandalism. You get 1080p HD streaming, a 130-degree field of view, the normal movement notifies, and a 90+ dB alarm that is likely to scare off any approaching burglar prior to they've got too far into your home. The privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera when you're at home and do not want to be taped.</p>
<p>After testing lots of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is super affordable, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
