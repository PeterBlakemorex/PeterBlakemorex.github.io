When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which suggests. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved.
