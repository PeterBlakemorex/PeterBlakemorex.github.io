<p>On the surface area, these two camera classifications may appear similar, though if you had the ability to see within, the differences become apparent and distinct. Commercial-grade cameras are developed and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not.

Some systems can be set up to allow deactivation of individual sensors or groups.  High-end systems permit numerous gain access to codes, and might even permit them to be utilized just when, or on particular days, or just in combination with other users' codes (i.e., accompanied).

Just like access codes, there can likewise be a hierarchy of oral codes, say, for furnace repairperson to enter the kitchen and basement sensor locations but not the silver vault in the kitchen.
