<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
