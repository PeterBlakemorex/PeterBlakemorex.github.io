<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular since the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers understand that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can integrate your smart outlets with your overall security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can control your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
