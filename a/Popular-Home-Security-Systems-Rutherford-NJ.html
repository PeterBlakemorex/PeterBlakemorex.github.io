<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
