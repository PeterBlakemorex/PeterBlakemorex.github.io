<p>Nevertheless, in any situation where standard-definition camera are utilized, the quality is going to be bad since the optimum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TELEVISION lines but the results are the same); they generally record horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
