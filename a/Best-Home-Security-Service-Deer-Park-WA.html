<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
<p>The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our system was faulty, and so we may revisit this evaluation.</p>
