<p>The biggest disadvantage of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets triggered while you're away, you have no visual means of confirming if something is in fact wrong and how major the scenario is.

<h2>How To Choose A CCTV System in South River</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, spanning several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually progressed into the highly advanced yet cost effective systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>

<p>Unlike conventional burglar alarms, which have a control panel (generally positioned in the entrance hall) that is used to arm and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have been triggered, smart alarms are controlled from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you have actually currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensors have actually been triggered, rather than getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and potentially irritating your neighbours).

<p>Wireless sensors secure all points of entry. Light, discreet & simple to place up to 200ft. from the panel. When a motion sensor detects motion in the room, it will immediately signal the control panel, triggering the alarm.
