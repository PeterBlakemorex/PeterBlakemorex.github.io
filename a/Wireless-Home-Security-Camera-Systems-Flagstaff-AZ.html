<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
