<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to neglect items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
