We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
