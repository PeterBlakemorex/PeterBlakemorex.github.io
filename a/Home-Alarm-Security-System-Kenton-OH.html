<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If catching video footage in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in multiple locations around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera using an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android smart device (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a wide array of equipment and home automation items at an affordable price, the one location where the company particularly excels remains in DIY installation. </p>
