Throughout screening, we discovered it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly activating when motion was spotted. We like that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency considering that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
