<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
