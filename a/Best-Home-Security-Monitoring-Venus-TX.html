<p>The Ring Floodlight Camera combines two vital devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera finds motion, it switches on its 2 powerful LED beams as well as its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Webcam also has a loud speaker, so you can talk with whoever remains in front of the camera, and hear their responses.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
