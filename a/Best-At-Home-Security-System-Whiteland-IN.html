<p>Think of it in this manner, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced video camera be sold for the low rate of forty dollars?

What good is a surveillance camera that only works ideally in ideal conditions like bright sunshine? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in specific scenarios such as nanny webcams or checking in on an animal, though when aiming to collect evidence of a criminal activity they typically come up short.</p>

All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such occurrences.

If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we don't think that these concerns alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our present suggestion.</p>
