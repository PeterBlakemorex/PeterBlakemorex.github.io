<p>Do burglar alarms account for burglary declines in the United States? The U.S. burglary rate has declined gradually and significantly considering that the early 1980s. 13 Throughout the very same time, the variety of properties with alarms rose, but there is no evidence of a link in between the two. During the 1990s through 2004, when alarm ownership experienced a high rise, other kinds of criminal activity declined simply as sharply as robbery, suggesting that factors aside from an increase in the variety of alarm systems fueled the robbery decrease.</p>
