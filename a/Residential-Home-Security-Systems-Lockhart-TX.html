<h3>Home Security System Cameras in Texas</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

We concur with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit limited to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>During our testing, this compact camera taped sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom worked for taking a more detailed look. We particularly like this camera's wide, 180-degree field of view, due to the fact that you're less likely to get a blind area wherever you set it up. For less than $400, you get two door and window sensing units, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
