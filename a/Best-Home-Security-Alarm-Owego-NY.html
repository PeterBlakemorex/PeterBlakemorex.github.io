<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered an information breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive step.

If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide.
