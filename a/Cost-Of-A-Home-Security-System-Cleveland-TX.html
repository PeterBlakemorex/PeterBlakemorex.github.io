If a house owner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms take place.

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
