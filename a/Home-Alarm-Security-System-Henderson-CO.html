The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the porch by a certified electrical contractor (who occurs to be my partner). All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
