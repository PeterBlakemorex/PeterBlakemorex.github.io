<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for additional wiring.

Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
