<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
