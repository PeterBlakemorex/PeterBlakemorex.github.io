<p>Heaven by ADT Outdoor Camera is a work in progress. We have actually seen improvements during our short time with the battery-operated camera, but we simply can't suggest a $200 camera that doesn't use the ability to zoom video and will not have the ability to hold up against outdoor temperature levels below 14 degrees Fahrenheit.
