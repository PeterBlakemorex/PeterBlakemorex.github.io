<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients recognize that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
