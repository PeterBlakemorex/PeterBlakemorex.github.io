<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over long distances.

Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
