So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Really annoying. Again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the lump sum, since obviously they car renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even identify people you've labeled (after a learning period).
