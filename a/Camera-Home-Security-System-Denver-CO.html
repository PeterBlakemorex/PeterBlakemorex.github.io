<h3>Business Security Systems in Denver CO</h3>
<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously excellent piece of innovation. For starters, it looks beautiful: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely reminiscent of the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). When you think of a home security camera, it's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you may call to mind.

In your area stored video is a good choice for do-it-yourselfers on a spending plan, but you have to be careful not to overwrite video you may need later.

Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some supply a dedicated storage drive that offers you DVR abilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it simple to find a video event that took place at a particular moment.</p>
