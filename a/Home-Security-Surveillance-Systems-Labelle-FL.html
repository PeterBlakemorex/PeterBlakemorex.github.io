<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. In a network injection attack, a hacker can use access points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, specifically broadcasting network traffic such as Covering Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects fake networking re-configuration commands that affect routers, switches, and intelligent hubs. A whole network can be brought down in this way and require rebooting or perhaps reprogramming of all intelligent networking devices.</p>
<p>This wireless security camera system is a three-camera plan that requires AA batteries and a WiFi connection to run.
