We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

Generally you would find a PCB with numerous terminals or antennas for connections. Numerous also have integrated backup batteries for wired systems and a phone or ethernet line in or out port.
