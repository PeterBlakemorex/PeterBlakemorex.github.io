<p>How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their newest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<h3>Commercial Alarm Systems Duarte CA 91010</h3>
<p>A number of other designs were disqualified due to performance concerns. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>This self monitored alarm has 4 smart modes-- Home, Away, Night, and Private. Based upon that, the camera switches on or off depending upon your place. The camera records 1080p videos with a 147-degree broad angle lens that minimizes all blind spots and gives you access to a broader field of view than many cameras. It is also equipped with a 3x digital zoom function that enables you to focus and record information such as facial features in case of burglaries.</p>
<p>When I eventually entered the camera controls, I was fairly satisfied. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the individual being seen understand they're being seen, and you can pick to tape-record video clips or images and conserve them to your wise gadget on an impulse. </p>
