Cameras are also exposed to anyone who approaches your home, so you need to think about how your video feed is secured from vandals smashing the camera. Vandal-proof cameras secure the camera lens from damage with a polycarbonate dome cover or metal real estate. Much like indoor cameras, consider how videos are kept, when the camera will film, and the quality of the video. You will get the best outdoor protection from cameras with a broad field of vision, high resolution video, and constant video feed that is submitted to the cloud.</p>
