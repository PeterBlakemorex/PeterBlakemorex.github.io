A wireless bridge is a great alternative for long range circumstances where poles and trees are not present.</p>
<p>Security: There have been lots of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, child displays, and other Wi-Fi devices to spy on people, so make sure to inspect what actions has each manufacturer required to eliminate this issue.

All smart-home devices are susceptible to such occurrences. Nevertheless, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells.
