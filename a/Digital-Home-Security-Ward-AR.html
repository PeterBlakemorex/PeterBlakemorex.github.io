When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
