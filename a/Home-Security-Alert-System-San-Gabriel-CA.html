<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment.

We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
