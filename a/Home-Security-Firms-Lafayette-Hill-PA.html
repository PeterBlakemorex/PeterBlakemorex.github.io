<h3>House Alarm System With Cameras Lafayette Hill PA 19444</h3>

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the porch by a licensed electrical contractor (who happens to be my partner).

We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
