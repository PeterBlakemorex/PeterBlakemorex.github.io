It can be sluggish and awkward to utilize on event - with the process of connecting to the camera for a live view rather sluggish sometimes. The previous, cheaper variation of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you want to conserve some cash - it does have actually a cable television connected though, rather than working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit easier to undermine for potential trespassers.
