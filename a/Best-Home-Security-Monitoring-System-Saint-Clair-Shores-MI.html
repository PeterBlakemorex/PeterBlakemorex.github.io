However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal security guard. A number of cities also need a permit to even own and operate a home security system. Rules such as these are created to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
