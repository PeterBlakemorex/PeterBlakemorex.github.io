Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security given that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
