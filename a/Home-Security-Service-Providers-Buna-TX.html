<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more liable for false alarms, and minimize the number of unneeded police and fire actions. Alarm monitoring companies are the experts and should be teaching their customers how to appropriately care and set for their alarm.

Alarm-monitoring companies have delighted in the benefit of police action to their customers' alarms with no accountability for the accuracy or reliability of those alarms.</p>

The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They might peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side.
