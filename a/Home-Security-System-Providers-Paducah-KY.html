<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the entire household will love. However for everybody who likes ADT, it seems like there's someone who's had an awful experience. Since ADT has more customers than most brand names-- which indicates it has more opportunities to run into problems, part of that is. But part of it is the way ADT sells its equipment. When a company works with several dealers and service providers, its consumers are going to get a broad variety of experiences. Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>

There are two elements at play in an alarm reaction: the monitoring center's reaction time and your local police department's. The monitoring center connected with your home security system must be alerted within seconds of an alarm (and contact you right after to verify the cause).</p>
<p>Pan, zoom, and tilt, or PTZ cameras are a favorite amongst those looking for more advanced performance. PTZ cameras can be changed for closer views, wide angles, or set to pan throughout a picked area. PTZ cameras can also integrate with mobile phones or computer systems, and can be managed by means of push-button controls or remote software application.</p>
