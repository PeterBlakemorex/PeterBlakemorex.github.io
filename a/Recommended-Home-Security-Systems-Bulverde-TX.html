<p>Smart alarms are simply as effective as conventional alarm systems however they do not constantly have an external siren that rests on the front of the house, which can act as a deterrent to intruders.

<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to neglect objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
