Commercial-grade cameras are created and developed for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not. Generally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is lots of offered light, and once the lighting ends up being absent or low (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Due to the fact that they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality parts that can adapt and record excellent low light video, commercial cameras exceed their less expensive cousins.</p>
<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All things emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature.

Since items are seldom precisely the very same temperature level as other objects around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>

And while this is a quite basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is relatively rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>
