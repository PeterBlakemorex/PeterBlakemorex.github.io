<h3>Local Home Security Companies in Washington</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it records a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notices and live views were painfully slow, and the range is poor. Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
