<p>A wired security camera is powered by a cable connection, and in some cases, a wired connection might be required for recording and keeping footage.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
