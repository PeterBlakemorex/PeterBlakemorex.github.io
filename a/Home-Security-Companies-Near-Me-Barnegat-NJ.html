<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
<p>We didn't think about alarm systems that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems typically cost more, use equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, included long and usually burdensome agreements, and often count on the exact same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they offer little advantage. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we've reviewed independently and don't advise for many people.</p>
