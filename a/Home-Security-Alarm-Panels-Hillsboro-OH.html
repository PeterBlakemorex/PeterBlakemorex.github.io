<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to ignore items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
