<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension set, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive overall per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it considering that its battery-saving regimens can disrupt efficiency.</p>
<p>The Kasa Webcam Outdoor is a good well-rounded weatherproof home security camera that costs less than $100. However, there are a few tradeoffs with this camera. Unlike other outdoor cameras on this list, the Kasa Camera has to be plugged in to an outlet to receive power, and while the camera is weather-resistant, the connection between its cable and power supply is not.</p>
