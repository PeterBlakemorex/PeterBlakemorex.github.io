<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
<p>A lot of video records images in the natural light or infrared spectrums. Thermal cameras can also catch video of a person's motions based upon body temperature.
