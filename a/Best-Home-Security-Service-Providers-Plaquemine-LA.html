<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are a little more pricey for the same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are burdensome, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyway.</p>
