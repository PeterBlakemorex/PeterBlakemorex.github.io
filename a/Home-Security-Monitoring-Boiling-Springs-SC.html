<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the fundamentals. However while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave gadgets, SimpliSafe systems do not.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
