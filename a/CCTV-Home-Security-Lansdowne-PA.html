The Arlo Ultra doesn't featured a totally free tier of cloud storage, so you need to invest at least $3 each month if you want to conserve any videos. And if you want to conserve 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera each month, on top of the month-to-month strategy, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.
