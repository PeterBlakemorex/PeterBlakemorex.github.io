<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, a detailed knowledge of all the needed systems is needed. If there are no as-built files providing performance and configuration details to make this integration work, there are only two choices. The first alternative, which may be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is unavailable or reluctant to provide those information) and record the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system.
