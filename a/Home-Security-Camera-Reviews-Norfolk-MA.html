<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies? I have actually dropped my Nest Cams considering that they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually identified intruders or wild animals.
