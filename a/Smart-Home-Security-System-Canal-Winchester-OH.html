<p>These cameras are capable of catching and transmitting really delicate data," says Cody Feng, a test engineer at CR's Digital Laboratory.

<p>This system employs an electro-magnetic field disturbance principle based on 2 unshielded (or 'leaking') coaxial cables buried approximately 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter emits continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is received by the other cable.

These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement.

And you can stop the monitoring and start service as lot of times as you desire.</p>
