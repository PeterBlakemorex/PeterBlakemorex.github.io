<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to third party companies?

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>Our experience with expert installation was blended. Our tester stated the technician offered strong client service: He dropped a couple of unnecessary window sensing units from my costs after deciding that the motion detector was sufficient for the whole front half of my home."
