<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the entire family will enjoy. But for everyone who loves ADT, it looks like there's someone who's had a dreadful experience. Part of that is due to the fact that ADT has more clients than most brand names-- which implies it has more possibilities to run into problems. However part of it is the method ADT offers its equipment. When a company deals with several dealers and service providers, its customers are going to get a broad variety of experiences.

<p>A system that needs a contract may be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?
