The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers cast doubt on the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or four totally free false alarms per fiscal year, since they supply no up-front rewards to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
