<p>A wired security system was the first type of security system that was developed for property owners. It needs to be set up by a professional alarm installation group and, as soon as installed, is difficult to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more common for big residential or commercial properties and are frequently more expensive than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system.

However, you will have to pay for additional $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) per month, and this doesn't featured expert monitoring. This extra cost isn't ideal, but when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- particular minimum prices per month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal. </p>
