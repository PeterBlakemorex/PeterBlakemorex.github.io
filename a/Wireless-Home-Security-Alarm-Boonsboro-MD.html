<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
