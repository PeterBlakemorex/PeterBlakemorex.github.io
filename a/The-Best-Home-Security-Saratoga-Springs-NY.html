<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to third party companies? I have actually dumped my Nest Cams given that they were bought by Google. Something all of us require to think of. Sirens. So your camera has detected burglars or wild animals. Do you want to frighten them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Note that these sirens may violate local noise control laws, so examine ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its understated appearances and face recognition software. The latter enables you to see precisely when a particular individual arrives at your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has broadened its security variety with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units known as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to release a smart smoke alarm and siren later this year, which makes this an even better proposition.</p>
