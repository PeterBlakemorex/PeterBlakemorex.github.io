<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal given that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.

The minute you drive out of signal range or turn your phone to aircraft mode is the moment you have actually left your house open.

However, with an unmonitored system, it depends on you to contact the cops or other emergency services if your home is in threat. Still, the unmonitored system is much less costly and therefore is still the much better option for lots of who are just worried about cost. </p>
